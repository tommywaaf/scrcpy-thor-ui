# ThorCrcpyButtons

> **Fork notice.** This is a downstream fork of the excellent
> [ThorCPY](https://github.com/theswest/ThorCPY) by *the_swest* with a
> handful of additions geared at making it look and feel more like a
> real AYN Thor on the desktop. Upstream ThorCPY remains the canonical
> project for the underlying dual-screen mirroring; please read its
> README too.

ThorCrcpyButtons is a Windows-based multi-window Scrcpy launcher,
designed specifically for the AYN Thor. It launches two scrcpy windows
(one for each display), embeds them into a native Windows container,
and adds a procedurally-drawn virtual button overlay around the bottom
screen that animates in real time with whatever you're doing on the
device.

**Primarily designed for Windows 11. Windows 10 (1809+) should work but bugs may occur.**

**For Linux users, please use the upstream Linux port:**

## What this fork adds on top of ThorCPY:

- **Virtual button overlay (chassis)** drawn into the empty space on
  each side of the bottom screen, matching the AYN Thor button layout:
  - Left strip (top → bottom): L1 / L2 LEDs, SELECT, left joystick, D-pad, HOME
  - Right strip (top → bottom): R1 / R2 LEDs, START, X / Y / B / A cluster, right joystick, BACK
  - Face buttons follow the Thor silkscreen: X top, A right, B bottom, Y left
- **Live input animation** via `adb shell getevent` from the Thor's
  *Odin Controller* node. Every press, release, axis movement and
  trigger pull is reflected in the overlay in real time — pills
  darken, ABXY circles dim, joystick caps offset by stick position,
  D-pad arms light up, L1/L2/R1/R2 LEDs glow red.
- **In-app FPS selector (30 / 60 / 120)** for the scrcpy stream.
- **Soft-restart button** in the control panel so you can apply scale
  or FPS changes without hand-killing the process.
- **`BUTTONS  ON / OFF` toggle** on the control panel that hides or
  shows the overlay at runtime; state persists in `config/config.json`.
- **Performance pass on the scrcpy pipeline:** H.265 codec with the
  MediaCodec `low-latency=1` option, 60 fps default, `direct3d`
  render driver, `HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS` for both scrcpy children, and
  a fix for the stdout/stderr `PIPE` buffer deadlock that previously
  caused intermittent stutter under load.
- **Window-sync optimisations:** geometry cache + removal of
  `SWP_NOCOPYBITS` so the embedded scrcpy windows aren't repainted
  60×/sec when the layout is static.

## Original ThorCPY features (unchanged here):

- Custom dual-screen support for the AYN Thor (wired or wireless)
- Dock or undock the screenshares for individual capture
- Layout presets for precise window placement
- Beautiful dual-screen clipboard screenshots with transparency
- Real-time positioning sliders

### Connection:
- To connect to ThorCPY, you can either connect via USB (Charging, offline and better connection) or Wireless (No tethers)
- To connect via USB:
  - Ensure you have followed the steps above to enable USB Debugging. 
  - Simply plug in your Thor and launch ThorCPY!
- To connect wirelessly:
  - Open ThorCPY without your device being connected via USB
  - Open the Wireless connection menu
  - In your Thor's developer settings, enable "Wireless USB Debugging" and press on the text to upen the submenu
  - Press "Pair with code" and input the IP address, Port and Connection code to pair your device and the computer.
  - Once the device has been successfuly paired, put the IP and port from the field "IP address & Port" in the settings in the "Connect by IP" settings.
  - Close the menu - ThorCPY will automatically restart!

### Main Controls:
- The ThorCPY control panel appears on the right hand side of your screen with the following controls:
- Global Scale:
    - Adjust the scale of the scrcpy outputs (requires restart)
- Layout Adjustment:
	- Top X/Top Y:
		- Adjust position of top screen
	- BOTTOM X/BOTTOM Y
		- Adjust position of bottom screen
- Window Controls:
	- Undock windows: Separate windows into independent floating windows (for individual window capture e.g. streaming layout)
	 - Dock windows: Bring undocked windows back into one, unified window
	 - Screenshot: Capture the entire docked view to clipboard (only works when docked)
       - Note: Screenshot background transparency is only available on Windows 11  
- Preset Management:
	- Adjust your layout as desired
	 - Enter a name into the preset field
	 - Click "SAVE" to save the layout as a preset
	 - Click "LOAD" next to a previously saved preset to apply it
	 - Click "DEL" next to a previously saved preset to remove it


## Configuration:

### Layouts/Presets:
- Presets are stored in config/layout.json
- You can manually edit this file if needed:
```json title:layout.json
{
    "Default": {
        "tx": 0,
        "ty": 0,
        "bx": 251,
        "by": 648,
		"global_scale": 0.6
    },
    "Streaming": {
        "tx": 100,
        "ty": 50,
        "bx": 300,
        "by": 700,
		"global_scale": 0.3
    }
}
```

### Config:
- More general config settings are saved in config/config.json
- You can manually edit this file if needed:
```json title:config.json
{
    "global_scale": 0.6,
    "tx": 0,
    "ty": 0,
    "bx": 251,
    "by": 648
}
```

### Scaling:
- The default scaling is set to 0.6 (60% of original resolution).
- An easier way to change this will be added in the future, for now you can modify `global_scale` in `launcher.py`.
- `self.global_scale = 0.6  # Change to desired scale (0.3 to 1.0 recommended)`

### Logging:
- Logs are automatically saved to logs/, with daily rotation. Log files are named:
	 - `thorcpy_YYYYMMDD.log` - Main application log
	 - `thorcpy_top_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log` - Top window scrcpy output
	 - `thorcpy_bottom_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log` - Bottom window scrcpy output
- To adjust log verbosity, modify the logging level in `main.py`:
```python title=main.py
logging.basicConfig(
	level=logging.INFO, # Change to DEBUG for detailed logs
	...
)
```

## Troubleshooting:

### Layout issues:
- Load the preset at 0.6 global scale and save it.
- Delete `config/layout.json` and `config/config.json` so they are reloaded

### Device Not Found:
- Ensure USB debugging is enabled on your Thor - Try a different USB cable (Ensure data cable, not charging-only)
- Revoke USB debugging authorizations and reconnect:
	- Settings -> System -> Developer Options -> Revoke USB debugging authorizations
- Check if ADB can see your device: `bin/adb.exe devices`
- Restart ADB server: `bin/adb.exe kill-server` then `bin/adb.exe start-server`

### Scrcpy won't start:
- Ensure that scrcpy.exe is in the bin/ folder
- Check logs for detailed error messages
- Try running scrcpy manually: `bin/scrcpy.exe -s YOUR_DEVICE_SERIAL`
- Update to the latest scrcpy version
- Ensure your device has the required display IDs (0 and 4)

### Windows Won't Dock:    
 - Wait a few seconds for windows to initialize
 - Try toggling dock/undock multiple times
 - Restart the application
 - Check logs for any errors

### Performance Issues:    
 - Reduce the global scale
 - Close other resource-intensive applications
 - Use a USB 3 port
 - Lower the max FPS in launcher.py (change --max-fps)
 - Reduce the video bitrate in scrcpy_manager.py

### Missing DLL or Import Errors
 - Reinstall dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall`
 - Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
 - Install Visual C++ Redistributables
